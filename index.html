								<h2>Story</h2>
								<p>While Amanda was scrolling through her social media account, she was stopped in her tracks by the news that her company is likely to be bought out by its greatest rival. She quickly posts a response, emails her colleagues about the incident, and shares the story with her contacts so that they can discuss it later. </p>
                                <p>But then Amanda has a troubling thought. What if the story wasn't true? What if she just shared a "fake news" story? After all, she didn't check the source. 
									If she has been a victim of fake news, and then added to the rumor mill herself, how will people ever trust her again?
									</p> 
								<p>Fortunately, there are lots you can do to avoid making the same mistake as Alice. Such ways will be discussed in the following sections for us on how to separate fake news from the truth.</p>

								<h2>What is Fake News?</h2>
								<p>Fake news is false or misleading information presented as news. </br>
									There are two kinds of fake news:
									</p>

								

								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-md-6">
										<h2 class="uppercase">Stories that have some truth but aren't 100 percent accurate</h2>
										<p>For instance, a journalist may misrepresent a politician's meaning by quoting only a portion of what they say. Once more, this might be done on purpose to
											 persuade readers of a particular opinion, or it could be the result of a simple error. In either case, it quickly attracts the audience.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-md-6">
										<h2 class="uppercase">Stories that aren't true</h2>
										<p>These are entirely invented stories designed to make people believe something false, to buy a certain product, or to visit a certain website.</p>
									</div>

								<h2>How?</h2>
								<p>Fake news is nothing new but, what is new is how easy it's become to share information, both true and false, on a massive scale. Almost everyone may share their thoughts or tell stories to the globe through social media platforms. The problem is that most people don't verify the content's reliability before sharing it, which can cause fake news to spread swiftly or even "go viral."
									 At the same time, it's become harder to identify the original source of news stories, which can make it difficult to assess their accuracy.</p>

								<p>This has caused a flood of fake news. The research conducted during the 2016 U.S. presidential election discovered that over 25% of Americans visited a fake news website for six weeks.</p>

								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-6">
								<h2>Consequences</h2>
								<p>According to research, 59 % are worried about the impact of fake news at work, and with good reason. For instance, some individuals may begin to think that they no longer require proof to support their claims. Others begin to completely mistrust information. They stop reading industry publications and quit participating in formal office communications,
									 which slows their advancement in the workplace. In the end, this may harm the learning culture of a business.</p>

								<p>Fake news has a behavioral impact as well. It encourages people to make up justifications, reject other people's opinions, exaggerate the truth and spread misinformation. This may lead to conflicted, nervous workplaces where employees lack confidence in one another.</p>
								<p>If they think that others in positions of power have lied to them or that the data, they are using is questionable, they may even start to mistrust you. People may lose the curiosity, enthusiasm, and desire necessary for successful collaboration as a result of this.</p>
								<p>Fake news and inaccurate information can potentially hurt your business. For example, fake product reviews or incorrect financial updates might seriously harm your reputation.</p>

					<h2>How to spot Fake News?</h2>
					<p>It can be really hard when it comes to determining which information is factual or not special with many sources of information. Here are some steps that simplify that:</p>

						<div class="feature-copy">
							<h3>1. Develop a Critical Mindset</h3>
							<p>One of the main reasons fake news is such a big issue is that it is often believable, so it's easy to get caught out. Much fake news is also written to create "shock value," that is, a strong instinctive reaction such as fear or anger.</p><p>
								This means it's essential that you keep your emotional response to such stories in check. Instead, approach what you see and hear rationally and critically.
								Ask yourself, "Why has this story been written? Is it to persuade me of a certain viewpoint? Is it selling me a particular product? Or is it trying to get me to click through to another website? Am I being triggered?"
								</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="feature-left animate-box" data-animate-effect="fadeInLeft">
						<span class="icon">
							<i class="icon-check"></i>
						</span>
						<div class="feature-copy">
							<h3>2. Check the Source</h3>
							<p>If you come across a story from a source that you've never heard of before, do some digging! Check the web address for the page you're reading. Spelling errors in company names, or strange-sounding extensions like ".infonet" and ".offer," rather than ".com" or ".co.uk," may mean that the source is suspect.</p>
							<p>Whether or not the author or publisher is familiar, stop to consider their reputation and professional experience. Are they known for their expertise on the matter? Or do they tend to exaggerate?</p>
							<p>Be aware that people who spread fake news and "alternative facts" sometimes create web pages, newspaper mockups, or "doctored" images that look official, but aren't. So, if you see a suspicious post that looks like it's from the World Health Organization (WHO), for example, check the WHO's site to verify that it's really there.

						<span class="icon">
							<i class="icon-check"></i>
						</span>
						<div class="feature-copy">
							<h3>3. See Who Else Is Reporting the Story</h3>
							<p>Professional global news agencies such as Reuters, CNN, and the BBC have rigorous editorial guidelines and extensive networks of highly trained reporters, so are a good place to start. But no one is unbiased, and anyone can make a mistake, so keep looking.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="feature-left animate-box" data-animate-effect="fadeInLeft">
						<span class="icon">
							<i class="icon-check"></i>
						</span>
						<div class="feature-copy">
							<h3>4. Examine the Evidence</h3>
							<p>A credible news story will include plenty of facts – quotes from experts, survey data, and official statistics, for example. Or detailed, consistent, and corroborated eye-witness accounts from people on the scene. If these are missing, question it!</p>
							<p>Does the evidence prove that something definitely happened? Or, have the facts been selected or "twisted" to back up a particular viewpoint?</p>
						</div>
					</div>

						<div class="feature-copy">
							<h3>5. Don't Take Images at Face Value</h3>
							<p>Does the evidence prove that something definitely happened? Or, have the facts been selected or "twisted" to back up a particular viewpoint?</p>
							<p>You can use tools such as Google Reverse Image Search to check where an image originated and whether it has been altered.</p>

						</span>
						<div class="feature-copy">
							<h3>6. Check That it "Sounds Right"</h3>
							<p>Finally, use your common sense! Bear in mind that fake news is designed to "feed" your biases, hopes, or fears. For example, it's unlikely that your favorite designer brand is giving away a million free dresses to people who turn up at its stores. Equally, just because your colleague believes that two married co-workers are having an affair, doesn't mean it's true.</p>
